### Object Oriented Programming
#### Expressing Requirements
*As a ______, I want to ________ so that ______.*
- blank1 => what is the role of user
- blank2 => goal that the user role  wants to achieve
- blank3 => reason why the user role wants this goal
Example:
As an **Online Shopper** I want to **add** an item to my shopping cart, so that I can **purchase** it.
Verbs help you identify the requirements that your objects might have, also identifies the connections between objects.
For example:
- "add" and "purchase" might be the responsibilities of shopping cart.
- One online shopper is typically linked with one shopping cart.

Noun corresponds to objects in your software. In the above example, I have identified three nouns:
- Online Shopper
- Item
- Shopping Cart

Verbs can help you to identify the requirements that your objects might have. In the above example.
Shopping Cart has the following responsibilities:
- add
- purchase

Verbs can also help to identify the connections between objects. In the above example, the connections can be following:
- One online shopper is typically associated with one shopping cart
- one cart should be caoable of holding multiple items


**NOTE:** User Strories are just one of many techniques that can be used to express requirements for a software system. Advantages:
- Simple to use
- can allow to apply object oriented thinking
- discover objects, requirements and connection

This helps to keep software well structured and more clear
